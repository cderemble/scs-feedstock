  summary: Python interface for SCS, which solves convex cone problems
  description: |
    Solves convex cone programs via operator splitting.
    Can solve: linear programs (LPs), second-order cone programs (SOCPs),
    semidefinite programs (SDPs), exponential cone programs (ECPs),
    and power cone programs (PCPs), or problems with any combination of
    those cones.
